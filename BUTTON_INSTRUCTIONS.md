## Button Interactions

All buttons in the app follow these interaction principles:

1. **Visual Feedback**: 
   - Buttons darken slightly when pressed
   - Interactive elements have subtle animation effects
   - Success/failure actions are accompanied by appropriate animations

2. **Haptic Feedback**:
   - Buttons provide haptic feedback when pressed (if device supports it)
   - Different types of feedback for different actions (success, error, etc.)

3. **Disabled States**:
   - Disabled buttons are grayed out
   - Tooltip appears explaining why a button is disabled when tapped

4. **Long Press Actions**:
   - Some buttons have additional functionality when long-pressed
   - For example, long-pressing a photo in the gallery shows delete/share options
   - Long-pressing the save button shows additional save options

## Optimized Camera Button Implementation

The camera capture button has been optimized in version 1.1.0 to provide a better user experience:

### Previous Implementation Issues:
- Pressing the capture button resulted in a several-second delay
- UI would freeze during processing
- No immediate feedback to the user
- Multiple button presses could cause errors

### New Implementation Features:
1. **Immediate Visual Feedback**:
   - Flash animation appears instantly when button is pressed
   - Status message updates immediately
   
2. **Background Processing**:
   - Photo processing (EXIF rotation, marking, saving) happens in background threads
   - UI remains responsive during processing
   
3. **Button State Management**:
   - Button is temporarily disabled during processing
   - Visual indicator shows processing state
   - Re-enables automatically when processing completes
   
4. **Implementation Details**:
   ```kotlin
   // Coroutine scope for background processing
   private val processingScope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO)
   
   // Button click handler
   captureButton.setOnClickListener {
       if (!isProcessingPhoto) {
           isProcessingPhoto = true
           showCaptureAnimation()
           takePhoto()
       }
   }
   
   // Immediate feedback function
   private fun showCaptureAnimation() {
       flashOverlay.alpha = 0.7f
       flashOverlay.animate().alpha(0f).setDuration(500).start()
       statusText.text = "üì∏ Snapshot taken! Processing..."
       captureButton.isEnabled = false
   }
   
   // Background processing
   private fun processPhotoAsync(imageFile: File) {
       processingScope.launch {
           // Process image in background
           // 1. Fix orientation using EXIF
           // 2. Create marked version
           // 3. Save both versions
           
           // Update UI on main thread when done
           withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
               statusText.text = "‚úÖ Photo ready!"
               captureButton.isEnabled = true
               isProcessingPhoto = false
           }
       }
   }
   ```

## Accessibility Considerations

All buttons in the app are designed with accessibility in mind:

1. **Size and Touch Targets**:
   - All buttons have a minimum touch target of 48x48dp
   - Adequate spacing between touchable elements (minimum 8dp)

2. **Color Contrast**:
   - Buttons maintain at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio with backgrounds
   - Critical buttons have higher contrast for better visibility

3. **Screen Readers**:
   - All buttons have contentDescription attributes for TalkBack
   - Custom actions are properly labeled for screen reader users

4. **Button Labels**:
   - Text buttons have clear, concise labels
   - Icon-only buttons always have text labels or tooltips

## Custom Button Styling

The app's minimalist Apple-inspired design extends to all buttons:

1. **Shape and Style**:
   - Rounded corners (12dp radius) on all buttons
   - Subtle drop shadows (elevation: 2dp)
   - Semi-transparent backgrounds (alpha: 0.9)

2. **Animation Effects**:
   - Scale-down effect when pressed (scaleX/Y: 0.98)
   - Ripple effects contained within button bounds
   - Smooth transitions between states (150ms duration)

3. **State Indicators**:
   - Subtle color shifts between normal/pressed/disabled states
   - Special states for critical actions (delete, save, etc.)
   - Loading indicators for operations in progress
